        I have a vivid memory of the summer I returned to home to Thornbridge. It was a dry year complete with a drought, but that didn't stop the local suburbanites from keeping their perfect lawns perfectly green. Pastel-colored rows of identical homes led me to my parents' driveway, my car full of my belongings. My dad sent me a small wave from the porch, while my mother rushed toward me so quickly she nearly fell out of her shoes.
            <br>
            <br>
        "Oh, Ben!" she exclaimed as she clamped me in her arms, "It's been so long!"
            <br>
            <br>
        "Okay, Mom," I said. The hug was lasting way too long,"You can let me go now."
            <br>
            <br>
        "It's just so good to have you home! You've been away far too long." She removed her arms, and I could breathe again. "So much has changed since you left."
            <br>
            <br>
        A cursory glance around the neighborhood told me that nothing had changed. Well...maybe not nothing. Something about the house at the end of the street, the only house that didn't come in the shade of an Easter egg, was different. I remembered it being a bit more rundown and ominous. When I was a kid, there were rumours that it was haunted. But, I had to say, the black house at the end of the street was looking better than ever.
            <br>
            <br>
        "Do the Strifes not live there anymore?" I asked.
            <br>
            <br>
        "Oh, they had a terrible accident a while back. It's just their daughter living there now." My mom answered.
            <br>
            <br>
        "You mean Edith?" She had been in my class in school, but I hadn't seen her in years. I had no idea something had happened to her parents.
            <br>
            <br>
        "Oh, is that her name? She's a bit odd." My mom shrugged her shoulders. 
            <br>
            <br>
        My dad had meandered over during our conversation, and was inspecting my car. Whatever he was looking at wasn't to his satisfaction. "Son, when was the last time you had this thing looked at? It's practically falling apart." 
            <br>
            <br>
        <i>I don't know Dad, maybe back before I got laid off and I had money.</i> "I guess it's been awhile." I said instead. 
            <br>
            <br>
        "I can tell." He responded before further needlessly scrutinizing my vehicle.
            <br>
            <br>
        "Come inside for some food, and we can unload your things later." My mom gestured for me to follow her.
            <br>
            <br>
        I took another glance at the Strife house before making my way inside.
